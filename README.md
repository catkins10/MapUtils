We have used Java Reflection APIs to Convert Map to POJO(Plaing Old Java Object).

Java Map Utils for Converting Maps to POJO.


Just Clone the project and add JAR Reference in your project.

Example of Code:

`
  Person person = MapUtils.convertMapToPojo(map, Person.class);
`

It's done.

Your map is converted into Pojo.
